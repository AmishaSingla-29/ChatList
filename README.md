# ChatList
This project is inspired from chat applications like WhatsApp, Telegram where we are given a chatlist. There are 2 types of operations in a chat list. First of them is when we get a new message so that message from that person actually goes to the top of the list and all the remaining elements shift down by one. The other operation is to delete a message. When a user deletes a message, all messages below it shifts one. So, vacuum is occupied by these messages.
